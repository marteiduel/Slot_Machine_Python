# Slot_Machine_Python
Python

This is a project to practice my Python skills, feel free to fork it and interact with it, even though it is not a pretty robust project it was fun to work on and refresh some Python skills. 
When betting on lines, it starts counting at the very top of the rows, ex. if you bet on one line you will be betting on the top row, if you bet on two you will be betting on the first and second rows.
